# Signs

Joining dungeon through signs requires Join Sign location configured in the dungeon group config. Once you have it configured, when the player clicks the sign, they will be put into an existing temporary room, if there is no room for the moment, a new temporary room will be created and they will be put inside. Also, you can configure a Leave Sign for players to leave the room.
