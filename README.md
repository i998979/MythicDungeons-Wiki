## About

MythicDungeons is the world's first plugin that provides a multi-instance dungeon system in the same world. Unlike any other plugin on the market that requires multiple servers for multiple instances, MythicDungeons lets your player be able to challenge the same kind of dungeon at the same time in the same world.

This plugin provides a complete teaming system, players can form a team to challenge the dungeon together. With full-featured GUI, everything can be accessed with simple clicks. Also, the brand-new Vertical Scrolling Scoreboard system provides endless information they need when waiting or even in-game.

Its objective-based design lets the player be able to explore the whole dungeon by killing different monsters or reaching specific checkpoints. The minibosses and final boss will only be revealed when those objectives are completed.
