# Actions, Completions & Fail Actions

## Actions, Fail Actions

`Actions` are a list of actions to do when the stage starts, it can be executing some commands, changing player's gamemode, or even creating MythicMobs spawners.\
`Fail Actions` acts the same as `Actions`, but it is a list of actions to do when the dungeon has failed at that stage.

## Completions

`Completions` are a list of actions to do when all `Objectives` are completed, it can be giving player items, spawning other mobs, or teleporting the player to somewhere else.
