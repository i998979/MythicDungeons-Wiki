# Configuring Dungeon

* Create `Ruins.yml` under `MythicDungeons/groups`
* Open the [full configuration](https://github.com/i998979/MythicDungeons-Wiki/wiki/Configuration#dungeon-group) if you are familiar with the configuration or [simplified configuration](https://github.com/i998979/MythicDungeons-Wiki/wiki/Configuration#dungeon-group-simplified) if you have no idea what's happening, some explanations below might not exist in the simplified configuration, ignore them at the moment and come back when you know what it does. **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE, YOU STILL NEED SOME MODIFICATIONS**
* `Ruins` is the ID of the Dungeon Group, it must be unique
